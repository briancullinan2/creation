# Creation

My take on combining Conway's Game of Life (Scrumfall) with "The Wheel of Time" (Rational Unified Process). Need to think of treating the Game of Live actors as particles instead of "cells" for a lower level of control.

## Short Term Goals

- CLI output for Game of Life
- Use RUP for micro-managing decision trees
- Combine multiple games of life at the same time to emulate cellular reproduction

## Long Term Goals

- Emulate mitochondria recombination
- Emulate mitochondria control over cellular response system
- Emulate RNA/DNA strand generation
- Reverse engineer a gnats brain, not to fly in the house
- Combine with https://www.wi-charge.com/ to control insects brains

## TODO

- Prove this can't be true, "Conway originally conjectured that no pattern can grow indefinitely", if consciousness exists, there should be infinite combinations of cellular life forms.
- Universal game of life, feeding existing systems into start conditions for specific cellular functions to predict and emulate real world events.
